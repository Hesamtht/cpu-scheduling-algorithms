CPU Scheduling Algorithms

## Introduction

CPU scheduling is a critical function of the operating system that manages the execution of processes by allocating CPU time. This repository provides implementations of several common scheduling algorithms to demonstrate their behavior and performance.

## Features
- FCFS (First-Come, First-Served)
- SJF (Shortest Job First)
- SRTF (Shortest Remaining Time First)
- MLFQ (Multi-Level Feedback Queue)
- Round-Robin
- Elevator (Disk Scheduling)
- Banker System (Deadlock Avoidance)
